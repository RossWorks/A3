Version 0.2 (21/4/2020)
A3is a GNU Octave tool that can estimate the lift and the drag (viscous, induced
and wave) of an isolatedwing. The estimation can be done for a single incidence
(101) or for multiple incidences (102).
The relation between cL and incidence is assumed linear and isbased on X-Foil
calculations.Several corrections accounts for compressibility,
sweep angle and diedral. All communications with the program happen via text
files or graphs plotted by octave. A3 is now on GitHub.
